      This is the projects section! Featured below are some projects I’ve
      contributed to and how I’ve contributed to them. While the focus is on
      computer science, engineering projects may be present :)

      This project was somewhat small, but did a great deal to prove the power
      of Rust despite how young it is as a language. The concept of the program
      was to listen for a call in a Discord chat which contained two locations
      and then return a Google maps route. Using Rust with Tokio and Serenity
      made talking with Google’s BigQuery and Discord’s API a breeze - allowing
      for the program to work with incredible response times. Tested against a
      similar program using the same APIs in NodeJS, the Rust program had a
      response time between a quarter and a fifth of the aforementioned NodeJS
      program. This is not to say NodeJS is bad or inefficient by any means -
      just at how impressively efficient Rust is.

      Engineering projects are always interesting to talk about! Besides the
      command and control aspect of programs responding to sensor data, the
      actual manufacturing of the device was quite the process. Space Age
      Agriculture was a small planter designed to work in zero or low gravity
      scenarios. Programming was mainly done with an Arduino in Arduino C. Soil
      moisture, water level, and light sensors were used to sense when three
      spinach plants should be exposed to grow lights and given more water. To
      make the planter work in zero gravity, the spinach would have to grow
      through a grid of sorts to keep any particulates from escaping. The water
      delivery was also specifically intended to overfill the planters, and a
      pump would then pull excess water out after a predetermined dwell time.
      This allowed for water use to be minimized - and for things like pH to be
      addressed directly in the future.

      Ecomapper is a current project I’m contributing to - which aims to help
      psychiatrists and therapists in an open source manner. The idea of the
      program is to give a tool to help visualize a patient’s interpersonal
      relationships for both the patient’s and the medical providers' benefit.
      The program is currently being written in ExpressJS on the backend - which
      is the team I’m a part of. As more details on this project emerge they may
      be added here.
