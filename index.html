      Hi there! My name is Ian Guy. I'm a senior at Portland State University
      and this website is the culmination of my first real foray into web
      design. Take a look around!
    </h1>
    <p class="bodyText2">
      Iâ€™ve spent most of my life in the Portland metro area - mostly out in
      Hillsboro. Computer science used to be a side interest to me, mainly
      focusing on engineering, but after a string of events I ended up in this
      great program at PSU! The program here certainly was challenging, but it
      was one that I was up for.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText2">
      Besides web development, my current professional interests are in upcoming
      languages and development tools. Having worked with Rust (read more in the
      previous projects section!) and with various APIs provided by Google and
      Discord, I find looking forward to what the future holds for program
      development to be of great interest.
