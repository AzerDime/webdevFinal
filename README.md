CS410 Intro to web dev final project.

WAVE reports no issues with accesibility and Lighthouse reports minor performance issues due to the use of large png files, but this is a non-issue in practice with a website of this scope. 
To run this code, I used VScode loaded with Live Server. Starting the server while the index.html file is in focus should be all that is needed. A github deployment is also available here: https://azerdime.github.io/webdevFinal/
