CS410 Intro to web dev final project.

WAVE reports no issues with accesibility and Lighthouse reports minor performance issues due to the use of large png files, but this is a non-issue in practice with a website of this scope. 
To run this code, I used VScode loaded with Live Server. Starting the server while the index.html file is in focus should be all that is needed. A github deployment is also available here: https://azerdime.github.io/webdevFinal/

A deprecated repo where I attempted to use EJS can be found here: https://github.com/AzerDime/webdevFinalDEPRECATED
This is where I did a good amount of work in the first week but had to scrap it.
A journal with my progress can be accessed by people with a pdx.edu email here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11V_x-nlOVuRalQ6hieu2tNsoiRVU2xizf_VW6DaShHk/edit?usp=sharing
